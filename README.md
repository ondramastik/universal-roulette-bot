# Roulette bot
## Motivation
My friend thinks he can play online roulette in a certain way that should be profitable. He spent a lot of time playing roulette and realized that it could be automated. So he came to me and I created this program for him.

## Functionality
Based on previous spins, this program is betting according to specific rules. I won't say which rules those are, but of course you can just check it in the code.
After each round, result of all bets are recorded. Currently there are two options. You can choose to record every result into a csv file, or you can choose to record everything into mysql database. If you go with the second option, you can go to https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/2d32e2b5-16b1-4a80-af56-73d04bc4a559/page/fKSlC and see all kinds of statistics.

## Status
In development. Currently the bot is working as desired, but there are still some things my friend would like to try.
